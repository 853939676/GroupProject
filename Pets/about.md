## About The Project

For our project we wanted to manipulate the King County dataset for lost, found, and adoptable pets! We display data in a visualization for questions like :

  * What percent of male/female pets have been lost/found/adoptable in the greater Seattle area?
  * What different breeds of pets have been lost/found/adoptable in the greater Seattle area?

### Table Feature
Supplies a tab that contains a search bar to:
- Directly sift through the data from the King County Dataset by key word

### Plot Feature
Offers the ability to:
- Distinguish between type of pet
- Change the information being displayed
- Change the visualization of the information

## About the Dataset

We worked with a .csv file and the data was collected from the years 2014-2018, which can be found [here](https://data.kingcounty.gov/Pets/Lost-found-adoptable-pets/yaai-7frk).

## Conclusion/Analysis

When analyzing the data we have found that 

* By gender, Dogs percentage was around a 50/50 percent rate, whereas cats were more in the 30/70 percent (male being the higher percentage in the lost category and females the higher percentage in the adoptable category). For the adoptable category gender was split up into male, female, spayed, neutered, and not neutered. Neutered male cats had the higher percentages in this category, as well as male dogs.

* By breed, the highest percentage of dog that was lost and adoptable was a Pitbull. Whereas cats were not specifically named by breed but by hair length, the domestic shorthair cat was the highest percentage in lost, found, and adoptable pets. For outliers, we can see that rabbits were the most lost and found pet in the King County area.
