## About The Project

For our project we wanted to manipulate the King County dataset for lost, found, and adoptable pets! We display data in a visualization for questions like :

  * What percent of male/female pets have been lost/found/adoptable in the greater Seattle area?
  * What different breeds of pets have been lost/found/adoptable in the greater Seattle area?

### Table Feature
Supplies a tab that contains a search bar to:
- Directly sift through the data from the King County Dataset by key word

### Plot Feature
Offers the ability to:
- Distinguish between type of pet
- Change the information being displayed
- Change the visualization of the information

## About the Dataset

We worked with a .csv file and the data was collected from the years 2014-2018, which can be found [here](https://data.kingcounty.gov/Pets/Lost-found-adoptable-pets/yaai-7frk).
