## About The Project

For our project we wanted to manipulate the King County dataset for lost, found, and adoptable pets! We display data in a visualization for questions like : 

  * What percent of male/female pets have been lost/found/adoptable in the greater Seattle area.
  * What different breeds of pets have been lost/found/adoptable in the greater seattle area
  * There is also an ability to distinguuish between type of pet, such as dogs, cats, or birds etc.
